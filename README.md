This repository contains a Plotly chloropleth map widget plugin for ActiveUI.

Its goal is to teach developers how to use ActiveUI SDK.

The used atoti notebook is versioned [here](https://github.com/Nouzbe/atoti-oecd-green-growth).

# ActiveUI Application

This is an turnkey data exploration application based on [ActiveUI SDK](https://github.com/activeviam/activeui-5/tree/master/packages/sdk). It can be used as boilerplate to develop other applications.

## Usage

See [the ActiveUI documentation](https://activeviam.com/activeui/documentation).

## Development

- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)
- Install dependencies: `yarn`
- Build packages: `yarn build`
- Start in development mode: `yarn start`
- You can now access the following:
  - [Application](http://localhost:3000)

When running a `start` command you can edit any package and see your changes reflected in the UI.

Happy hacking!
